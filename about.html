                    <h1>About</h1>

                    <p>Born Like This is a community based organization based in Kenya (Kisumu county) established in May 2015, which is aimed at providing a safe, nurturing and loving environment to people living with disability. It was out of love that
                        this organization was established, taking it from our motto <q>disability is not inability.</q> We are seeking to instill such mentality in these young people so that they do not give up on their dreams because of their condition.</p>

                    <p>In addition to disabled people, we are also spreading the love to widows and orphans. This initiative was started by Mrs. Phoebe Onyango, who was touched to see how children and women suffered because their parents and husbands had
                        died of HIV/AIDS and how some of these children who were living with disability lost their self-confidence because they couldn't accept themselves as they are. She believed that a touch of love is what they needed; she wanted to
                        give them love. So far she has been taking care of them in a small shelter and receiving food donations from local churches to help feed them.</p>

                    <h3>The Issue</h3>
                    <p>The disabled children are being mistreated, the children are orphans and homeless, women are widows and what these people need is love, support and to be given an opportunity to better their lives. We believe that empowering these
                        people empowers the nation; these children are the future of our country.</p>

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Our primary objectives are to provide shelter, food, and clothes. We would also like to equip them with skills and empower them to unleash their potential regardless of any unfortunate circumstances.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2">
                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>To see all disabled, orphans, and widows living their full potential and the disabled knowing that they were born that way, but their disability does not mean inability to do anything.</p>

                    <h3>The Program</h3>
                    <p>We are seeking to achieve our objectives by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Promoting literacy:</strong> Seeking book donations and distributing among them, having structured storytelling, and reading out loud sessions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Promoting arts and culture:</strong> Poetry, drama, crafts</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1" id="closing">
                    <p>Our organization hopes to achieve key things like education, our own shelter, our own well to fetch water, and our own therapy center. It can be very difficult for these individuals to receive the care they need since those with disabilities
                        are often stigmatized and discriminated against. Thankfully, Born Like This serves as a voice for these people and is committed to providing a safe and loving environment for people with disabilities.</p>
